# Twenty One (Alternative)
This is the game 21, done in React and Tailwind.  
Play against the computer in this online card game. The goal is to try to get your score as close to 21 as you can without going over. Be sure to get a higher score than the computer player.  
Note: This is something I am still working on so please excuse any errors. Thank you!

## Improvements for the Future
 - Use algorithm to make the computer player smarter. The computer should know when to stand.
 - Add tests to ensure the functionality is correct.
