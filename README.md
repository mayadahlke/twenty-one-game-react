# Twenty One
### By: Maya Dahlke
This is the game 21, done in React and Tailwind. 

To play 21, with two players, you can follow these rules:  
- **Dealing**: The dealer gives each player two cards face up, and one card face down.  
- **Goal**: Players try to get closer to 21 without going over.  
- **Play**: Players can choose to "hit" or "stand" after receiving their first two cards. "Hitting" means asking for another card, while "standing" means keeping the current hand.  
- **Point values**: Jacks, Queens, Kings, and 10s are worth 10, while Aces can be counted as 1 or 11. All other cards are worth face value.  
- **Busting**: If a player's hand goes over 21, they "bust" and lose.  
- **Ties**: If both the player and dealer have hands that are tied, the game is a "push".  

## Possible Improvements
 - In the original game players place chips as a bet, so I could add chips and keep score of the chip value amount of the player.
 - The original game also has splitting and doubling down, so if chips were added I could add this as well.
 - I could add other players to make it multiplayer
